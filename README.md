A project intended to be loaded into IntelliJ alongside the JDBC jar file as a dependency. At this time, it only allows one stored procedure or SELECT clause to be ran at a time. Any other commands will be ignored by the GUI. This package is intended only for presentation purposes.

Any EXEC queries will run without issue as long as they do not return a result set.
